Basic Navigation of the VINL system and a class.


# Navigate! #


After logging into VINL, the home page will be displayed.  All of the courses currently in the VINL system will be listed on the bottom of the page while general information about this copy of VINL will be listed on the top half of the page.  In order to access a class, you must be enrolled in it.

After clicking on the desired class’ link, you will be brought to that class’ homepage.  Here you can see all of the actions possible for a student in the VINL system.  In the center of the page is the week by week layout for the particular class.  On the right are a calendar and an announcement tab.  On the left are Activities and Administration tabs.

Under Activities are all of the Assignments and other activities that can be created for a class.  Under Administration are Grades and Profile.  Grades is exactly as it sounds; it is a list of all of the grades for all of the assignments for the class.  Profile is your personal profile in the system.
