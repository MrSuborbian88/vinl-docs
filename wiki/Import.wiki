#summary How to import data from one course into another

*Import* allows you to apply to the current course data from any other course for which the teacher has editing rights. This will allow teachers to re-use instead of re-creating one or more activities and resources.

This feature will not import student or teacher data, such as forum posts and discussions. It will only import the structure of such activities.

==How to use import course data==

  # Select the Import option from the [[Course administration block]] (see below).  
  # Next, select the course you wish to import from and click the ''Use this course'' button.
  # You will be presented with a check box list from which you can select the type of activities or resources you wish to import (see below). 
  # Finally, click ''Continue'' when done to import that data. 

==Tips==

  * You can import individual items within a module type.

  * Backups, offer other creative ways to bring in course material along with an option for student data.
