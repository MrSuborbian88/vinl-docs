#summary VINL Guidelines and Standards

==Best Practice Evidence==

  # *Project website/wiki:* We have a wiki on GoogleCode. (http://code.google.com/p/vinyl/)
  # *Project management website:* Also on GoogleCode (see link above).
  # *Code repository:* Still on GoogleCode (see link above).
  # *Documented Coding Standards:* We tried to adhere to Moodle's coding standards (reproduced here: http://code.google.com/p/vinl-docs/wiki/CodingStandards) as closely as possible.
  # *Build tools:* Moodle came with an Ant/maven build already built in; we tried to keep the installation and running of VINL fairly similar to Moodle, so we were able to use Moodle's build, start, and stop scripts unchanged.
  # *Design patterns:* A description of the design patterns used in VINL can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/vinyl/downloads/detail?name=Factory%20design%20pattern.doc&can=2&q=#makechanges
