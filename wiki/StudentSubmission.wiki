= Hey, Look! =

When you access a course’s home page, you might notice that there is a list of weeks right in front of you.  You might also notice that your teacher has posted an assignment in one of the week slots.  This means that you have to submit an answer in order to complete it and pass the class.

In order to access the Assignment’s page, simply click on the Assignment’s link listed on the home page of the course.  The Assignment’s name and information will now be displayed in your browser window.  Make sure that you understand what the Assignment is asking for, so that you can get the correct answer.  There are multiple types of Assignments in VINL and each requires a different submission process.

All of the details for an Assignment are located on the Assignments web page.  There you can see what is required in order to correctly submit that particular Assignment.
