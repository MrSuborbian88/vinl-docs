## Best Practice Evidence ##

  1. **Project website/wiki:** We have a wiki on [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/vinyl/)
  1. **Project management website:** Also on [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/vinyl/)
  1. **Code repository:** Still on [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/vinyl/)
  1. **Documented Coding Standards:** We tried to adhere to Moodle's coding standards (reproduced [here](http://code.google.com/p/vinl-docs/wiki/CodingStandards)) as closely as possible.
  1. **Build tools:** Moodle came with an Ant/maven build already built in; we tried to keep the installation and running of VINL fairly similar to Moodle, so we were able to use Moodle's build, start, and stop scripts unchanged.
  1. **Design patterns:** A description of the design patterns used in VINL can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/vinyl/downloads/detail?name=Factory%20design%20pattern.doc&can=2&q=#makechanges).
